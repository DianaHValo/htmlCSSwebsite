There is nothing stronger than a mother’s love, and this mother cat proved it by bringing her sick kitten to be cared for at an animal hospital in Instanbul, Turkey.
As the doctors rushed to help the kitten, the mother cat reportedly didn’t leave her kitten’s side. The medics checked both the kitten and the mother for any obvious health issues.
The doctors also made sure that the mother cat had milk and food, and the two cats were later put in a vet’s care. The kitten is said to be doing well, and hopefully, they both will find good homes soon.

Pixi was just a small baby when he showed up at Barra's house one day two years ago. Being an animal lover, she decided to take him in — raising the feeble kitten into the friendly cat he is today. And as Pixi grew, so too did his love of adventure.
These days, Pixi likes to come and go, refueling on food and affection at home in between explorations around town.
But as Barra recently discovered, he's been doing more than just exploring.
The other day, Barra watched Pixi return from one such adventure and noticed something different — he was a wearing a collar she'd never seen before. Was her dear kitty two-timing her? Barra had to find out. She grabbed a pen and a piece of paper.
"My name is Pixi the cat," she wrote. "I think he has two houses haha." Barra then put the note under Pixi's collar.
Not long after, Pixi slipped away again as he usually does — unaware that this time, because of the note, his elaborate ruse was about to unravel.
When he returned home to Barra, she found him with a note written by someone else.
"Here he is called Huarache," the note said. "It appears that he does have two houses haha. Greetings!"Pixi had been busted. And so, too, had Huarache, for that matter.
The cat had been leading a double life — presumably with double the affection and rations of food.
"I told him, 'I know your secret,'" Barra said.

  <p style="color:white;">
  <br>
  A frisky feline has been left with a broken leg after jumping from a 40ft (12.2m) balcony in a bid to get some sweet, sweet lovin.

Mischievous Molly was in season at the time, and her owner had gone to extreme lengths to stop her from going out and getting knocked up - but the efforts were no match for a horny kitty.

Molly jumped four storeys from the flat's balcony and was found with a broken leg and pelvis. A passerby was kind enough to take her to the vets and she's now on the mend.

Sadly for her, she never got to have sex.

  <p style="color:white;">
  <br>
	  One of the most standard wedding traditions is the throwing of a bouquet of flowers to determine who will be the next to get married. But Karen Marmo, who is known for being a huge cat lover, had another idea in mind.Karen has two kitties of her own at home named Catbug and Luna. Unfortunately, they were unable to attend the wedding. Because of this, Karen decided that she’d like to include a fun way to honor them.
And how did she do it? Instead of throwing flowers, the bride decided to throw a plush cat toy instead.
But there was a “catch” to the catch. She asked whoever was lucky enough to capture the plush cat toy bouquet to become the next person to adopt a real cat.
“I thought it’d be a fun way to include everyone regardless of gender or marital status, and it was very ‘me’ since everyone knows I’m obsessed with cats,” said Karen.
Since everyone seemed receptive to the idea, Karen bought a Pusheen cat toy for the special event and started to plan everything out.
When the big day arrived, Karen was more than ready to toss her plushy new friend into the crowd of wedding guests standing around in anticipation behind her. However, there was some irony involved and things didn’t quite go as planned.

“The person who caught it was my friend, Emma,” said Karen. “She didn’t mean to catch it since she’s allergic. Guests fumbled the stuffed animal and it landed on her when she was shielding her face. I donated to my local shelter to make up for it.”
Even so, it was clear that everyone loved what the bride was trying to accomplish, and hopefully, this can help encourage more brides to do the same in the future.</p>
